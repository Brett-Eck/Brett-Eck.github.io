        <h1> Problem Statement</h1>
        <p>Parking at the University of South Carolina in Columbia is oftentimes convoluted and difficult for many students and faculty, especially those who park in lots rather than garages. Sometimes students and faculty may drive to lots just to find them completely full. </p>
